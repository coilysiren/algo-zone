# ./data/*

category folders containing stuff to be sorted, and their already sorted variants

## structure

```
cat-breeds/
  randomized.txt
  sorted.txt
  # no more files! just those two!
dog-breeds/
  randomized.txt
  sorted.txt
dinosaurs/
  randomized.txt
  sorted.txt
# and so on...
```

in the example above, `cat-breeds` `dog-breeds` and `dinosaurs` are all "category folders".
